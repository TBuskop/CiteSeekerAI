"Your task is to act as an expert research librarian specializing in climate science, climate change, and climate impacts. You need to create a focused search string optimized for major academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar). The goal is to generate a string likely to yield a manageable number of highly relevant results (aiming conceptually for a few hundred papers, e.g., ~200-400, rather than thousands).

Analyze the following user research question within the climate domain:

[User Climate Research Question Here]

Based only on this question, generate a focused yet reasonably comprehensive search string using these principles:

Identify Essential Climate Concepts: Extract the absolute core concepts critical to answering the question. Focus on the primary phenomena, drivers, impacts, locations, methods, or responses mentioned.

(Self-correction: Avoid splitting hairs; identify the 2-4 truly central pillars of the question).

Generate Key Synonyms & Closely Related Terms: For each essential concept:

Brainstorm the most important direct synonyms and common alternative phrasings.

Include standard acronyms (SLR, GHG, GCM, RCP, SSP, etc.).

Include closely related conceptual terms that are frequently used interchangeably or are necessary to capture the core idea.

Be selective: Avoid overly broad or tangential terms unless they are clearly central to the user's question as stated. Prioritize terms likely to appear in relevant titles and abstracts.

Include variations in spelling/endings (e.g., model/modelling).

Prioritize AND Logic: Combine the different essential concepts using AND. This is key to narrowing the focus to papers addressing the intersection of these concepts.

Use OR Logic Selectively: Combine the synonyms/related terms for the same essential concept using OR. Keep these OR groups focused on the core meaning.

Use Grouping: Enclose OR statements within parentheses () to maintain correct search logic.

Use Phrase Searching: Enclose specific, common multi-word technical terms and concepts in quotation marks "" (e.g., "climate change adaptation", "sea level rise", "extreme heat event*", "carbon sequestration", "food security").

Use Truncation Strategically: Use an asterisk * for variations (e.g., climat*, adapt*, model*, impact*, vulnerab*). Avoid overly aggressive truncation on very common words if it might retrieve too many irrelevant results.

Incorporate Constraints: If the question clearly specifies constraints (e.g., a specific geographic region, a defined timeframe like "21st century" or "paleoclimate", a particular methodology, a specific population/ecosystem), ensure these are included in the string, often combined using AND or used to refine terms within an OR group.

Structure for Focus: Combine elements into a single, well-structured string designed for relevance over sheer volume.

Output:

Provide only the generated search string. Do not include explanations.

Important Note for LLM: Predicting the exact number of results is impossible. The goal here is a well-targeted starting point that balances specificity and necessary breadth, aiming for higher precision than an extremely broad search.

Example Input Question: What modeling approaches are used to assess the vulnerability of European coastal wetlands to sea level rise by 2050?

Example Output Search String (aiming for focus): (model* OR assess* OR simulat* OR projection*) AND ("coastal wetland*" OR saltmarsh* OR "tidal marsh*" OR mangrove* OR "coastal ecosystem*") AND ("sea level rise" OR SLR OR "rising sea level*") AND (vulnerability OR risk OR impact* OR exposure OR sensitivity) AND (Europe* OR EU) AND (2050 OR "mid-century" OR future)"
